      <p>My name is Victor Tsang  and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer based in San Francisco.  My interest in web development started when my friend invited me to join his business in selling truck accessories on eBay.  We began with templates that eBay provided but didn't like any of them, so I self-taught myself html and css to create my own templates.  I enjoyed the marketing part of the process, which is why I decided to major in Marketing.
      </p>

      <p>Fast foward a couple years and realized I enjoyed making web sites, so I spent a couple of months trying to learn modern web development on my own. I don't think the way I try to learn is the most efficient which is why I applied to the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.
